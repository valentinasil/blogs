	"humans need not apply" its a short clip about our future and technology. As we know technology is adavancing everyday more. there's positivies and negatives about it and this videos picks up some of them. robotics are build to make our jobs and life easier, they can replace some jobs humans used to do, this is something many poeple are afraid since it would mean in the future they would be able to take more than low-skilled jobs and eventuallly their would be new jobs.
</p>
<p>
	I think this video makes a lot of sense, technology could eventually replace more of our jobs and I dont think is impossible since its already doing it. but I also think even if technology could be great and multitask diferent jobs, it would just not be the same as human, they eventually fail and they would not be able to do their job efficiently, after all the reason they exist is because of us.

		<h4>Alyssa Gonzalez </h4>
		<p>After reading Valentina's first blog post, I felt as if she wrote a good opening to the overall blog. She did bring up how much technology has dramatically effected us in our daily lives whether it be the fact it be the benefits us or how technology has replaced most of our jobs. You're doing great sweetie, keep us the good work! ;) </p>

"SMILE WHILE WE SNAP!" is a small reading of how now a days is so easy to take a picture and post it online and peple can assume things based on how it looks in the picture. I think is interesting how now we can use pictures for evidence.	
</p>
<p>
"BLACK BOXES ARE NOT JUST FOR AIRPLANES ANYMORE" this is about the fact that we have black boxes for cars since 2011, it captures speed, braking time , turn signal, and seat belts.	
</p>
<p>
	"THE PARKING GARAGE KNOWS MORE THAN YOU THINK" is about the parking lots and how people dont notice every license plate is being photograph as it enters and how we dont know if that data stays and who has access to it.
</p>
<p>
	In my opinion now a days is so easy to have acess to any data that someone can find us know everything about us , get a perspective of what we post , know if we are guilty or not based on evidence by a "black box" or by a picture.

		<h4> Ali Ghaly </h4>
		<p> I agreed with the evidence since humans cannot hide from the technological advancements that is placed in society's hands and these advancements have all the records of your information based on where you live and what you do in your daily life. I like the background color you placed for your blog since it makes the picture feel connected with your blog.</p>

		<p>I liked your interview and I'd have to agree with your dad that technology has helped us in many ways and made things easy to do our school work and even for jobs as well. Also I liked the colors you picked out for your blog very aesthetic!</p>
